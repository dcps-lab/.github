# DCPS Lab  
## Deterministic Cyber-Physical Systems Laboratory

The DCPS Lab focuses on deterministic embedded architectures, secure communication frameworks, and power-aware cyber-physical systems for critical infrastructure and industrial applications.

---

## 🎯 Mission

To investigate and develop deterministic, secure, and high-reliability embedded systems that integrate computation, communication, and energy domains.

---

## 🔬 Research Focus

### 1️⃣ Deterministic Embedded Architectures
- Real-time communication analysis
- Latency and jitter evaluation
- Embedded systems performance characterization

## 🧪 Methodological Standards

All DCPS Lab projects must include:

- Clearly defined research problem
- Explicit hypothesis
- Quantitative performance metrics
- Reproducible experimental methodology
- Statistical analysis (mean, standard deviation, confidence interval)
- Version-controlled source code
- Organized datasets

Projects that do not meet these criteria are not considered official DCPS Lab research outputs.
